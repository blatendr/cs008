<h1>Well Hello there!</h1>
<p>This is the home page for the exclusive secret group for Team Gary Busey. If you follow the link 
to the form page you can input your email address to receive all your needed Gary Busey facts. 
Some of these will include his current wearabouts, when his birthday is, and where he is heading next.
Crap, I was really hoping this would end up in more words, you see cause I am currently only at 76 words.
24 more words to go, almost there, I really feel like we should only be required to write like 50 words, 100 
is too tedious.
