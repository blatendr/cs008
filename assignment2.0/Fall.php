    <h1>There are a lot of fun things to do during the Fall!</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>During the Fall Season there are lots of great hikes that are definitely worth checking out!</li>
        <li>There are lots of fun holidays during the Fall like Thanksgiving and Halloween that are a complete blast!</li>
        <li>If you have a hunting license there are a lot of fun game to hunt in the fall</li>
        <li>Does anyone actually read these parts? I feel like the requirement for one hundred words is unneeded and usually just a waste of everyone's time</li>
        <li>In the fall the weather is usually a good mix of warm and cold so outside sports are enjoyable. I need four more words.</li>
