        <li>If you are near a pond or ocean cool off at the beach! It is super relaxing and usually pretty cheap!</li>
        <li>If that doesn't work out you can always head to a local pool!</li>
        <li>Camping is a great activity and it is good to get some fresh air every once in a while</li>
        <li>There are lots of sports you can play like soccer, lacrosse, baseball and croquet!</li>
        <li>Having a bond fire at night is a very comfortable thing to do and is very relaxing</li>
