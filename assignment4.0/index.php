<p>The web site I picked to discuss this week is:http://www.squarespace.com/</p>

<p>I really like the design of the web site, it is very pleasing and is well done</p>



<p>I do not like how scroll based the web site is, there are only four main pages in the nav and it takes 
    a while to scroll all the way to the bottom and back to the top. a "Back to top" button would be very helpful</p>

<p>In the web site when you scroll up and down, text and pictures move towards the middle of the screen,
This looks pretty cool and looks really nice on a site</p>

<h1>The goal of this web site is to look nice and convince other people to get sites made with this company's
cause they will do a good job. Short term the goal of this site is to buy a site, long term is to maintain it.</h1>

<p></p>

<h1>What results would you like to see on the web site?</h1>
<p>All the example web sites they have done in a neat list, right now you have to go through multiple menus to see all the sites </p>

<h1>Who is your intended audience</h1>
<p>The intended audience is anyone who wants to make their own web site and cannot do it themselves </p>

<h1>What type and level of navigation do want to provide for the web site? (home button, site map, menues on every page)</h1>

<p>Every main page has a nav bar on the top whic seems to suffice</p>

<h1>Why will people visit your site? What will they be looking for: Information, Products, Entertainment?</h1>

<p>They are looking to create a good looking web site</p>

<h1>Would you go back to this site?</h1> 

<p>Maybe if i wanted to see some examples to draw some ideas off of for the design of a site, but thats about it</p>
