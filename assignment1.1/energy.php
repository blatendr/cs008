        <h1> Follow these tips to save electricity </h1> 
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure to turn the lights out when you leave a room, this may not do a lot in the short run, but it really adds up over time</li>
            <li>If you don't have energy saving fluorescent light bulbs in your house, change them now!</li>
            <li>Cut the power to energy drawing devices. A lot of electronics still draw power even if they are off, unplug that shit! </li>
            <li>Try to get your power from renewable sources, a lot of places give this option and it puts pressure on non-green electrical company's</li>
            <li>Another great way to utilize green energy is to install solar panels or a wind turbine, the government subsidizes a lot of home based green energy and they will pay for themselves in due time    </li>
